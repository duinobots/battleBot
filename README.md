Arduino Board and IDE setup

Repo Setup Instructions:

1. Download the repo into the My Documents/Arduino folder and rename the folder to 'battleBot'. The name of the .ino file and the folder must be the same, including casing.

Installing additional libraries:

Depending on your build version (Adafruit or Tiny Circuits) the Arduino sketch requires one or more additional libraries to run. Please see the respective build guides for each version on duinobots.com for instructions on installing the additional libraries.
